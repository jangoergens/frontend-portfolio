# Top Comment Finder - Beyond the Algorithm

## Getting Started

Run `pnpm all` in the root repo. This will install all dependencies, build the project, and run the test suite. After that, you can run `pnpm start` inside of this folder to start the local website.

## Why this project?

The existing YouTube comment-sorting algorithm may not cater to everyone's preferences, particularly when browsing older videos.

To address this issue, I've developed a user-friendly platform that enables you to effortlessly access the genuine top comments from any YouTube video. All you need to do is enter the video's link.
