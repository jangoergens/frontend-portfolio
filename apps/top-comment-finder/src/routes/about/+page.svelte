			YouTube's comment system prioritizes newer comments to keep things fresh. That's great for
			recent uploads, but it makes it tough to see the top comments on older videos. Basically, it
			buries the original reactions people had when the video first came out.
		</p>
		<p>
			I built this tool to fix that. Just paste a YouTube video link, and it'll show you the top 20
			comments based solely on their upvote count, regardless of when they were posted. No more
			digging through a pile of recent comments to find the highest rated comments from back in the
			day.
