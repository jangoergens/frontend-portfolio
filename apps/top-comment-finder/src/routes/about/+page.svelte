			Welcome to the About page of my project, dedicated to putting the power of comment sorting
			back into the hands of the YouTube community.
		</p>
		<p>
			YouTube's current algorithm doesn't suit everyone's preferences, especially when it comes to
			comments under older videos. It has a strong recency bias, often promoting new comments with
			very few likes and overshadowing valuable older comments.
		</p>
		<p>
			With this in mind, I have created a platform that allows you to easily access the top 20
			comments from any YouTube video simply by entering its link. This user-friendly and unbiased
			solution saves you time and ensures you can enjoy the most relevant and engaging comments
			without the influence of YouTube's recency bias.
